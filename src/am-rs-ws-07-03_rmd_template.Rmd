title: "W07-3: Change detection"
output: html_document

In order to speed things up a little, here is a template for a markdown file
which can be used as part of this worksheet.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(sp)

inpath_lc <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/landcover/"
```

### Reading land-cover classification from 2001 and 2013
```{r}
lc_2001 <- raster(paste0(inpath_lc,"l7_lc_rf.tif"))
lc_2013 <- raster(paste0(inpath_lc,"l8_lc_rf.tif"))
```

### Compute differences
Adjust landcover ids, first.
```{r}
# Your code here
```

### Save change detection data to file
Assuming, that the differences are stored in `lc_diff`.
```{r}
writeRaster(stack(lc_2001, lc_2013, lc_diff), 
            filename = paste0(inpath_lc, "change_detection.tif"),
                              format = "GTiff", overwrite = TRUE)
```
