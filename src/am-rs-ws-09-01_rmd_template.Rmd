In order to speed things up a little, here is a template for a markdown file
which can be used as part of this worksheet.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(sp)

inpath_ecol <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/ecology/"
inpath_l8 <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/landsat/l8_2013-07-07/"
inpath_rapideye <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/rapideye/re_2010-10-11/"
inpath_lidar <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/lidar/"
```

### Load remote sensing data
Load dataset and adjust names of the bands (which will be required in the
next session, too).
```{r}
# Your code here
```

### Compile stacks for the two regions
Compile a separate stack for each region containing the satellite sensor and
the LiDAR data.
```{r}
# Your code here
```
