In order to speed things up a little, here is a template for a markdown file
which can be used as part of this worksheet.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(sp)

inpath_ecol <- "D:/active/moc/am-remote-sensing/examples/data/ecology/"
```

### Read datasets
Read remote sensing and ecology datasets and remember to adjust band names
```{r}
# Your code here.
```

### Compile dataset
Combine vegetation records with plot information and merge with remote sensing 
dataset. Create a merged shape file for each region and one which contains both
regions.
```{r}
# Your code here.
```
